Topic: Arrays - Thinking in patterns (Max/Min/Count)

Most array problems are just:
- Keep a best value
- Compare
- Update
- Return

Pattern to remember (VERY IMPORTANT)
Initialize → Loop → Compare → Update → Return

Pattern you must remember:

For max/min problems:

Initialize with first element
Loop from second element
Update only when condition is true
Return result

I understand now:
- Why else is not needed in max/min - we are updating the value in if condition only
- Why we update only on condition - we are checking the min/max condition with array element , if it is true then update otherwise no update
